Direction of use:
================

1. Place all the database/corpus images (.jpg) in "data" folder relative to the path this file is in.
2. Put the single query image in the path were this file is placed.
3. Source code is written using Matlab 2013a.
4. main.m is the main program file to be run.


Known issues:
=============
1. Solution works with a single query image at a time.
2. all the images (only with .jpg extn) are used in the data folder non recursively.
